  what is left of every subscription, plan and key uni-switch has: each window's use and
  when it starts again, and each key's balance, asked of the vendors now (or less than
  a minute ago). --json is for scripts and agents, each entry with lastServedAt, when it
  last answered through the gateway, and last: true on the latest; the gateway answers the same at
  GET http://127.0.0.1:3425/v1/uni-switch/quotas (on the port in Settings' Gateway address).
  This endpoint is available on this computer only.
  A Codex account that holds rate-limit resets says how many; quota reset spends one,
  starting the account's current windows again (the one Codex is signed in to unless
  named): the one that runs out first, or with --card n the nth to run out (2 the
  one after the soonest; one that never runs out comes last). It can't be undone, so
  it asks first, naming the reset; --yes doesn't. quota auto-reset on lets
  the account spend one by itself when its weekly window is used up and no other
  account can take a request, or before a request goes on its credits, one a week
  at most (the five hours running out never does), and spend the one about to expire half an hour before it does, if
  the account's windows have been used, so what they have left can be used until
  then and it isn't lost; at once when the account is held up until after then.
  week on|off or expiring on|off turns only one of those two times on or off, the
  other kept as it is: expiring on alone waits out a used-up week (the vendor may
  reset it) and still spends the reset about to expire.
  It is the account's standing setting, held resets or not; off stops it, and alone
  it says which accounts have it on. It is off until turned on.
  quota auto-reset lead 2h spends the one about to expire two hours before it does
  instead, for every account, from 15m to 24h; default puts back the half hour, and
  alone it says what is set. Earlier loses what the windows have left then.
  quota credits off keeps a Codex account from spending its credits: once one of
  its windows is used up, by uni-switch's latest reading (refreshed about every
  minute), routing holds it as used up until that window renews and the request
  goes to the other accounts, groups and fallbacks, or is refused with why (with
  auto-reset on, its week used up and no one else left, it spends a reset first).
  on, the default, lets the vendor answer on its credits then, so the task goes
  on (with auto-reset's week on, a reset held is spent before the credits); last spends
  them too, but only after everything else: once a window is used up the account is
  tried after every other account, key and fallback that isn't on its credits, so a
  subscription, then an API key, then the credits. first spends them before moving
  on: while the account holds credits, routing keeps it where it was and Codex stays
  signed in to it, instead of going to an account with room. Alone it says which
  accounts don't spend theirs and which spend them first or last.
  quota alert 80 has the uni-switch app notify when any window of a subscription or plan
  reaches 80% used, once each time the window runs (not windows set aside, such as
  on-demand spending); --balance 5 when a balance falls to 5 or under, in its own
  currency or credits, once until topped up past it. off turns either off, and alone
  it says what is set. Both are off until set.
  quota wait codex returns once any Codex account uni-switch has on has allowance again
  (a window that stops it no longer used up), and an account's email or login, or
  <provider>/<account>, waits for that one alone: it reads the vendors itself, gateway
  running or not, again shortly after the soonest reset (every 1 to 10 minutes), and
  says on stderr what it waits for. For a script to go on with work it stopped:
  until codex exec …; do uni-switch quota wait codex || break; done. Exit 0 once there
  is allowance, 1 when --timeout (30m, 6h) passes first, 2 for a name it doesn't
  know, 130 on Ctrl+C.
  quota history is what uni-switch has read of each subscription's and plan's windows
  over time, kept 45 days (UTC times, a reading only when it changed, each window's
  runs apart by when they reset): the latest readings of each window, or with --json
  every one since --days days ago, as GET /v1/uni-switch/quotas/history?days=&provider=&user=
  answers. A provider, an account's email or login, or <provider>/<account> narrows it.
  A reading is kept at the time it was read: a Claude account's, which Claude Code
  tells only as it answers or runs /usage, isn't written again each time it is shown.
  quota refresh reads one card again, as its refresh button on the Usage page does:
  the provider's, or of the one account named (<provider>/<account> works too), and
  shows only it, --json with each card's readAt and error. A saved Claude account is
  read by running Claude Code's /usage in its own folder, which plain uni-switch quota
  never does. A card read less than 30 seconds ago isn't asked again: what was read
  then is shown.`
