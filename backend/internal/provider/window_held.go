// WithHeldWindows is qs with HeldBy set on each window whose remainder an
// account can't spend: another of its windows that stops it for every
// model (usedPast's rule: not aside, no model of its own, not past its
// reset) is used up and starts again only after this one does, so what
// this one has left is lost at its own reset, unspent. An account with 0%
// of its 7 days left and 100% of its 5 hours has no 5 hours to spend, and
// the Usage page's all-accounts strip, the tray panel's and the Routing
// groups' (mergeQuotas) count it as none left rather than as a full window
// (hayden4608, handong66: three such accounts and one with its 5 hours
// used up read 75% of 5 hours left in all, #4791). It isn't so the other
// way: a week with 22% left behind five hours used up still has that 22%
// once the five hours start again. A ChatGPT account that goes on on its
// credits isn't held. Another uni-switch's cards are as it sent them; qs and
// its windows, which the caches share, are left as they were.
