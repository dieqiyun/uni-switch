// Package claudeseal carries Claude's signed reasoning through a Responses
// client (mysterious_dove_96933 on Discord).
//
// Claude signs each thinking block and seals a redacted_thinking block
// whole, and Anthropic wants both back as they came on the next request
// of a tool loop. A Responses client such as Codex, with store off, keeps
// only what a reply's reasoning items carry, and of those only
// encrypted_content is opaque. So uni-switch writes the block there: "uni-switch-
// claude1:" and the block's JSON in base64, which only uni-switch reads. Sent
// to OpenAI it would be refused as invalid_encrypted_content, so the
// gateway drops it before any Responses upstream, and a rollout is made
// portable by dropping it there (sessions.PortCodexRollouts).
