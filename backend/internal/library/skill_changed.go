package library

// A skill from GitHub can be changed on this machine after it was
// installed: the user edits it in the library's folder, an agent it is
// linked into edits it there, or an agent's copy is edited and taken in
// (skill_edits.go). An update from GitHub takes its files in place of the
// library's, so it would undo such a change without a word (#1449). So
// the library tells a changed skill by the hash of its files as fetched
// (Skill.Hash): the page says it was changed here, an update of it alone
// asks first, an update of many leaves it as it is, and the version an
// update replaces is kept with the backups unless it is known to be
// GitHub's own.
//
// A skill may ask to have its dependencies installed in its own folder
// (npm install in easyeda-api-skill; ggbr on Discord). What that writes
// (node_modules, a Python virtualenv, bytecode, the lock file written
// again) is the install's, not a change of the user's: it neither marks
// the skill changed nor is lost to an update, which carries it over to
// the version fetched (carryInstalled).
