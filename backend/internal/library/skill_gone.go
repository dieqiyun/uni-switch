// it came from was read, and its folder isn't there any more. An update
// then has nothing to fetch, which is no failure of the update: the skill
// is marked removed from its source (Skill.Gone), for the page to say so
// and offer to take out every such skill of a source at once. Nothing is
// taken out by itself, as the user may keep using it. Only a source read
// whole tells: a fetch that failed, or a skill left out of a fetch as too
// big, says nothing of whether it is still there.
