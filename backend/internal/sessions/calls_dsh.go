// DeepSeek Harness's calls, read as its session summaries are (dsh.go): an
// "assistant/message" carries the model and the usage of the request that
// answered with it, one per line, so every such line is one call.
//
// The Sessions page has read these files all along — dsh.go parses the same
// event for its summary — but the usage ledger never asked for them, so dsh's
// tokens reached the Sessions page and nothing else: the Usage page showed
// only what the gateway itself served, which is nothing before uni-switch was
// installed and nothing at all for a dsh pointed straight at a vendor.
//
// A call through uni-switch's gateway is logged by the gateway as well, and dsh
// sends it no session header, so the two records cannot be paired up
// afterwards: it is left out here as OpenCode's and ZCode's are
// (dshGatewayProvider), or it would be counted twice — once by the gateway
// with the provider and account that really answered, and once here as a
// nameless local session. The provider a session's record names is kept as
// history (Upstream), never as proof of the route.

// dshCallFiles are dsh's sessions as call sources. It is dshFiles with the
// size and time its summary reader already keeps, so a session that has not
// changed is not read again. A subagent's file is a source of its own, as
// WorkBuddy's subagents' are: nothing in this path reads a file's main (the
// Sessions page's mark for a session's own file), so it is left as dshFiles
// set it.

// the frame it left off in (frames.go), as parseDsh reads it. A file cut
