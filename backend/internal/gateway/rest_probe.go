package gateway

// A key resting after an outage that names no time — a 5xx, its vendor
// unreachable — rests a minute, longer each time it fails again, while
// the keys ready beside it take the requests, so nothing asks it whether
// it is back before its rest ends (heatonz on Discord: a key back up
// waited out its rest, or a click on Try now). The gateway asks it in the
// background instead: its vendor's model list, with the key and the proxy
// it goes through, a minute into its rest, then two minutes on, then
// five, then every ten, and lifts the rest as soon as the list answers.
// A list costs no allowance, and none is asked of a subscription's
// account, a plugin's, or a rest whose end the vendor or the user named
// (out of quota or credit, a Retry-After, a window full), which ends on
// time; nor of a rate limit, which a list answers while the chat endpoint
// still refuses, or of one model alone. A list answers for the vendor,
// not for every model behind it, so a rest the list lifted that fails
// again is not asked again until the key answers a request.
