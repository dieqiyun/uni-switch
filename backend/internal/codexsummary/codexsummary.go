// Package codexsummary is the compaction uni-switch answers Codex with when it
// compacts a conversation itself (a model of uni-switch's, or Codex's own
// models through uni-switch's accounts), and the message it stands for.
//
// Codex keeps a compaction item whole, encrypted_content and all, in its
// rollout, and sends it back as it is with every later turn. uni-switch's is
// "uni-switch1:" and the summary in base64, which only uni-switch reads: sent to
// OpenAI itself (uni-switch quit, or disconnected) it is refused as
// invalid_encrypted_content, and the conversation can't go on (LukeMa on
// X). What it is read as is the message Codex's own local compaction
// keeps in its place: its summary prefix, a newline and the summary, as a
// user message, which Codex knows for a summary (is_summary_message).
// The gateway sends that in place of the item, and a rollout is made
// portable by writing it there (sessions.PortCodexRollouts).
