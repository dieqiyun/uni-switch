// Package lastgood keeps the last good generation of uni-switch's own state
// files (accounts, sign-ins, providers, settings) and reads it back when
// the file itself can't be read.
//
// A Windows machine that went down mid-write left logins.json and
// plugin-auth.json at their full length with every byte zero (#1505).
// uni-switch then read no accounts, and its next write made that final. Here a
// file that is there but not valid is unknown, never empty: before each
// write the file there now is kept as <file>.bak when it is valid, or
// copied aside as <file>.bad-<time> when it isn't, and a read of a file
// that isn't valid gives the .bak's contents instead, noted for the GUI and
// the log.
